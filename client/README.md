## Note Testing
You can specify which reporters are used in your project's karma.config.js file.
For example, the 'dots' reporter just prints a dot when each test passes:
reporters: ['dots'],
The 'progress' reporter prints more than dots:
reporters: ['progress'],
The custom reporter karma-spec-reporter prints the name of each test when the test succeeds or fails (but not much else):
reporters: ['spec'],
